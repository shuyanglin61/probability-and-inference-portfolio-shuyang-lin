## Introduction to the roulette game
In this case, the roulette game is simplified as fairly and randomly choosing one number among 1 to 38. There are 38 pockets in total, 18 are red, 18 are black, and 2 are green. The payout for a bet on black (or red) is \$1 for each \$1 wagered. This means that if a gambler bets \$1 on red and the randomly selected pocket is red, then the gambler will get the original \$1 wager and an additional \$1 as winnings. ^[https://github.com/thomasgstewart/data-science-5620-fall-2021/blob/master/deliverables/01-roulette.md] 

The model we will introduce is a simulation of a classic roulette strategy named the "Martingale" strategy. The gambler will only wager on red at every game. If last outcome is red, he will keep wager $1 on red; if last outcome is black, which means he lost his wager, he will wager twice the amount he previously wagered, still on red. Here's a chart for this strategy:

![Chart-1: Martingale strategy](roulette.png)


## Code for simulating

The following code is for simulating the procedure.

### A single round

First, we make a single spin of the roulette table as a random choice of a color among red, black and green. Be aware that we weight them in different amount.

```{r eval='hide',cache=TRUE}
single_spin <- function(){
  possible_outcomes <- c(rep("red",18), rep("black",18), rep("green",2))
  sample(possible_outcomes, 1)
}

```

As we realize the spin, we could simulate the strategy of deciding the wager amount by this following code:

```{r eval='hide' ,cache=TRUE}
martingale_wager <- function(
  previous_wager
  , previous_outcome
  , max_wager
  , current_budget
){
  if(previous_outcome == "red") return(1)
  min(2*previous_wager, max_wager, current_budget)
}
```

The function takes the output of the previous wager decision and the last outcome of a spin as an input to decide the amount of wager this time. It uses an if-else line to copy the options we have discussed above.

After completing these two functions, we are able to simulate one-time game process:

### A single game

```{r eval='hide' ,cache=TRUE}
one_play <- function(previous_ledger_entry, max_wager){
  # Create a copy of the input object that will become the output object
  out <- previous_ledger_entry
  out[1, "game_index"] <- previous_ledger_entry[1, "game_index"] + 1
  out[1, "starting_budget"] <- previous_ledger_entry[1, "ending_budget"]
  out[1, "wager"] <- martingale_wager(
    previous_wager = previous_ledger_entry[1, "wager"]
    , previous_outcome = previous_ledger_entry[1, "outcome"]
    , max_wager = max_wager
    , current_budget = out[1, "starting_budget"]
  )
  out[1, "outcome"] <- single_spin()
  out[1, "ending_budget"] <- out[1, "starting_budget"] + 
    ifelse(out[1, "outcome"] == "red", +1, -1)*out[1, "wager"]
  return(out)
}
```

Every time we start a new play, we take the previous game as input of information. We decide the amount of wager based on the result of the last play. The result of one play will be stored in a list, including the game index, the budget balance at the start, the wager amount, the color of this play, and the budget balance at the end.

### A series of games

Since we have completed one-play, we are able to simulate the whole process that a gambler walked into the casino, had some starting money, decided a winning threshold, and started playing the game until he was satisfied or bankrupt. 

```{r eval='hide' ,cache=TRUE}
one_series <- function(
  max_games, starting_budget, winning_threshold, max_wager
){
  # Initialize ledger
  ledger <- data.frame(
      game_index = 0:max_games
    , starting_budget = NA_integer_
    , wager = NA_integer_
    , outcome = NA_character_
    , ending_budget = NA_integer_
  )
  ledger[1, "wager"] <- 1
  ledger[1, "outcome"] <- "red"
  ledger[1, "ending_budget"] <- starting_budget
  for(i in 2:nrow(ledger)){
    #browser()
    ledger[i,] <- one_play(ledger[i-1,], max_wager)
    if(stopping_rule(ledger[i,], winning_threshold)) break
  }
  # Return non-empty portion of ledger
  ledger[2:i, ]
}
```

Noticing that in real-world the casino and human beings will not play the game or wager the money infinitely, we will set a maximum number of the plays, and a maximum amount of wager that could be spent. Therefore we have 3 stopping rules and 1 wager rule: the gambler would stop playing and leave the casino when he played too many plays, went bankrupt or won enough money; the gambler could not wager more than he had or the amount the casino set.

```{r eval='hide' ,cache=TRUE}
stopping_rule <- function(
  ledger_entry
  , winning_threshold
){
  ending_budget <- ledger_entry[1, "ending_budget"]
  if(ending_budget <= 0) return(TRUE)
  if(ending_budget >= winning_threshold) return(TRUE)
  FALSE
}
```

As the game is for winning money, we simply calculate the total profit of the whole process by the ending budget of the last play minus the starting budget before the first play.

```{r eval='hide' ,cache=TRUE}
profit <- function(ledger){
  n <- nrow(ledger)
  profit <- ledger[n, "ending_budget"] - ledger[1, "starting_budget"]
  return(profit)
}
```

### Addition to the solution 2
We may also calculate the amount of the number of plays as the following:

```{r eval='hide' ,cache=TRUE}
number_plays <- function(ledger){
  nrow(ledger)
}
```

### Simulation parameters

Now we could start our simulation. First we should notice we have 4 parameters each time we run a simulation:

|       Parameter       | Description                     |             Starting value             |
|:---------------------:|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------------:|
|       max_games       | Time threshold for stopping     |                200 plays               |
|    starting_budget    | Starting budget                 |                  $200                  |
|   winning_threshold   | Winnings threshold for stopping | $300 (Starting budget + $100 winnings) |
|       max_wager       | Casinoâ€™s maximum wager          |                  $500                  |


We find two typical gamblers by setting a certain seed. The first one is a loser who at last ran out of his budget and leave the casino. The second one is a winner and reached the winning threshold. The x-axis is the plays' indexes, and the y-axis is the budget after each play.

### Loser
```{r cache=TRUE}
require(magrittr) # including a library we need for drawing charts
# loser
par(cex.axis=2, cex.lab = 2, mar = c(8,8,4,4))
set.seed(1) # set the seed for random numbers so that the output will be the same every time we run this code
ledger <- one_series(max_games=200, starting_budget=200, winning_threshold=300, max_wager=500)
plot(ledger[,c(1,5)], type = "l", lwd = 5, xlab = "Game Index", ylab = "Budget")
```

We could see the loser has their budget run out at last.


### Winner
```{r cache=TRUE}
# winner
par(cex.axis=2, cex.lab = 2, mar = c(8,8,4,4))
set.seed(2)
l2 <- one_series(200,200,300,500)
plot(l2[,c(1,5)], type = "l", lwd = 5, xlab = "Game Index", ylab = "Budget")
```

The winner had their budget exceed the threshold. Though he did once lose his profit, he still stood up and won after that.

## Experiment on the parameters

Now we will try to see if changing the parameter will show difference of outcomes. Each time we will vary only one parameter based on (200,200,300,500) we used before.

We will generate 1000 gamblers with seeds from 1 to 1000. It's a game for earning, so we will focus on the budget at last. Also, regarding the average number of plays before stopping, we will calculate it while changing the maximum amount of plays and the starting budget.

### Changing the maximum amount of plays
```{r results='hide' ,cache=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
ave_earnings1 <- vector()
ave_times1 <- vector()
max_plays <- vector()
for(j in 1:50) {
  max_plays[j] <- j*10
  game_result <- replicate(1000, one_series(j*10,200,300,500), simplify = FALSE)
  ave_earnings1[j] <- mean(sapply(game_result, profit))
  ave_times1[j] <- mean(sapply(game_result,number_plays))
  print(j)
}
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
par(cex.axis=2, cex.lab = 2, mar = c(8,8,4,4))
plot(max_plays, ave_earnings1, type = "l", lwd = 5, xlab = "Maximum plays", ylab = "Average ending budget")
```


We increased the maximum play by 10 each time from 10 to 500, showing a reduction of average ending budget among 1000 gamblers.

Besides, we try calculating the average play times:

```{r cache=TRUE}
par(cex.axis=2, cex.lab = 2, mar = c(8,8,4,4))
plot(max_plays, ave_times1, type = "l", lwd = 5, xlab = "Maximum plays", ylab = "Average plays")
```

We could see that at the beginning average plays will increase as maximum plays do, then after the maximum plays exceed 200, the growth trend is stopped. This number means the whole series is expected to end at approximately the 200th play.

### Changing the starting budget

As we decide the winning threshold to be $100 plus starting budget, here we need to change it the same as the starting budget.


```{r results='hide' ,cache=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
ave_earnings2 <- vector()
starting_budget <- vector()
for(j in 1:50) {
  starting_budget[j] <- j*10
  #winning threshold = starting budget + $100
  game_result <- replicate(1000, one_series(200,j*10,j*10+100,500), simplify = FALSE)
  ave_earnings2[j] <- mean(sapply(game_result, profit))
  print(j)
}
```

Then we draw the chart:

```{r cache=TRUE}
par(cex.axis=2, cex.lab = 2, mar = c(8,8,4,4))
plot(starting_budget, ave_earnings2, type = "l", lwd = 5, xlab = "Starting budget", ylab = "Average ending budget")
```


Still we increased the starting budget by 10 each time from 10 to 500, showing a curve of average ending budget among 1000 gamblers. The more the starting budget is, the more the gamblers lose.


### Changing the winning threshold

We could simply know that wininng threshold should be more than the starting budget, so here we start changing it from $210.

```{r results='hide' ,cache=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
ave_earnings3 <- vector()
ave_times3 <- vector()
winning_threshold <- vector()
for(j in 1:50) {
  winning_threshold[j] <- 200 + j*10
  game_result <- replicate(1000, one_series(200,200,200+j*10,500), simplify = FALSE)
  ave_earnings3[j] <- mean(sapply(game_result, profit))
  ave_times3[j] <- mean(sapply(game_result,number_plays))
  print(j)
}
```

Then we draw the chart:

```{r cache=TRUE}
par(cex.axis=2, cex.lab = 2, mar = c(8,8,4,4))
plot(winning_threshold, ave_earnings3, type = "l", lwd = 5, xlab = "winning threshold", ylab = "Average ending budget")
```

The winning threshold shows a difference when less than 300. After that, it did not show apparent correlations.

Let us check the play times:

```{r cache=TRUE}
par(cex.axis=2, cex.lab = 2, mar = c(8,8,4,4))
plot(winning_threshold, ave_times3, type = "l", lwd = 5, xlab = "winning threshold", ylab = "Average plays")
```

After $300, winning threshold won't change the average plays apparently. This might due to the starting budget.

### Changing the maximum wager

We change the maximum amount of a wager at last.

```{r results='hide' ,cache=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
ave_earnings4 <- vector()
max_wager <- vector()
for(j in 1:50) {
  max_wager[j] <- j*10
  game_result <- replicate(1000, one_series(200,200,300,j*10), simplify = FALSE)
  ave_earnings4[j] <- mean(sapply(game_result, profit))
  print(j)
}
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
par(cex.axis=2, cex.lab = 2, mar = c(8,8,4,4))
plot(max_wager, ave_earnings4, type = "l", lwd = 5, xlab = "Maximum wager", ylab = "Average ending budget")
```


The maximum wager shows no apparent correlations.


## Conclusion and limitation

As a result, we may see that no matter how we change the parameters, the average profit is always less than 0, which means we are expected to lose most the time. The situation may vary among different participants, different rules and different time. Do remember this case is a simulation only. We simplify the spinning process as a random pick of a number among 1 to 38, but in real-world the table, the ball, and the people turning the spin, all those aspects will count. The random library in R is also based on pseudorandomness. Everything we calculated is just within an ideal model.
